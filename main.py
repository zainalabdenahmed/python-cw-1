# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
x1=7
x2=1
print=(x1+x2)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
x=4
y=2
print=(x/y)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
x=5
y=2
print(x*y)
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length = 10
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area = (length*width)
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable

print(f"the result is {area}")
# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.
