# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
print(3 + 5)

# Write a print statement that uses the division operator /

# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length = 15
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 25
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area = width * length
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f"The result is {area}")

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print(f"If the length of the rectangle is {length} , and width is {width} Then the area is {area}")
